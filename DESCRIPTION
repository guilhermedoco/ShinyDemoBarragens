Description: A small package that implements the 'geyser' shiny app inside a 
    package.
    The geyser shiny app is the small app provided by the RStudio IDE when you
    click to create a new "Shiny Web App...".
    In this package that shiny app has been broken up into parts as a
    demonstration of how one might approach the packaging of such an app.
